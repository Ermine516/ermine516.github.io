David received his PhD in 2015 in the field of Computational Proof
Theory from the Technical University of Vienna.
After defending, David joined the Research Insitute of Symbolic
Computation (RISC) as a postdoc, participating in several
projects, between 2015-2020, in the fields of runtime verification,
unification theory, and didactics. In 2020, David received a young
researcher fellowship from the Linz Institute of Technology (LIT) for
his project on inductive learning and proving. Simultaneously, He
received a tenure-track faculty position (Scientist) at the Czech
Academy of Sciences Institute of Computer Science (CAS ICS) in the
Department for Artificial Intelligence. During his time at CAS ICS, he
was awarded a grant from the Czech Science Foundation (GACR) for his
project on proof analysis through automated reasoning methods.
Additionally, in 2023,  he joined the core management of the
EUROPROOFNET Cost Action (leader of the working group on Machine
Learning and proofs), which ran from 2021 to 2025. In 2025, David joined
the Dynatrace research team (distributed database systems).
His main areas of expertise are automated reasoning, inductive
reasoning, and computational logic. He has given several invited talks
on these topics and regularly contributes to the subjects.
